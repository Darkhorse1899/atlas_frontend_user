      The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) is a federal law
      that affords parents the right to have access to their children’s
      education records, the right to seek to have the records amended, and the
      right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable
      information from the education records. When a student turns eighteen (18)
      years old, or enters a postsecondary institution at any age, the rights
      under FERPA transfer from the parents to the student. The FERPA statute is
      found at 20 U.S.C. § 1232g and the FERPA regulations are found at 34 CFR
      Part 99. Atlas abides by the laws, rules, and regulations set forth in
      FERPA, and this Website also abides by such laws, rules, and regulations.
